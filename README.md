# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Crystal

I'm 26 years old and have been coding in C since I was 12, I swear I have a hold on the basics.

Native & low-level systems engineer who enjoys doing things in a difficult way more than building actual stuff.

## ðŸ’¡ Interests & Expertise

- Low-level systems programming
- Android ROMs and Kernels
- Kernel & OS development
- Reverse engineering & binary analysis
- Pointless nanosecond optimization at the assembly level
- Embedded systems (not a big fan anymore since it's my work)

## ðŸ”­ What I'm Up To

- Trying to get familiar with **x86-64 Assembly** because I still suck at it.
- Tinkering with the **Linux Kernel** purely because I have interest in Android internals.
- Breaking things in **AOSP** and occasionally fixing them.
- **Reverse Engineering** games and cracking stuff.
